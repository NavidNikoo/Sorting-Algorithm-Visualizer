# Sorting Algorithms Visualization Project
This project aims to deepen understanding of sorting algorithms by implementing, analyzing, and visualizing the performance of various sorting techniques in Python using Matplotlib. Students will gain practical experience in algorithm implementation, performance analysis, and the use of visual aids to demonstrate complex concepts!

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NavidNikoo/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the visualization:
   ```
   python src/visualization/visualizer.py
   ```
